Himu wears a yellow panjabi that does not have a pocket and lives a mostly nomadic life. He walks barefoot on the streets of Dhaka without a certain destination. He does not have a job and, therefore, no source of income. He prefers the life of a beggar to that of a hard worker, often praising begging.
